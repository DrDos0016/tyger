A Python ZZT world interpreter.

This was my first exercise in learning Python. It is outdated, completely unplanned, and very poorly written. But it will load and roughly play some ZZT worlds.

I've moved it to Github as Google Code is shutting down and would like to preserve it. I would be very wary of actually using this as anything other than a curiosity.
